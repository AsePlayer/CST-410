● Create a new scene and download the Standard Assets from the Unity Asset Store
o Note: This will give you access to the character controller and terrain assets in
the videos.
● Add terrain
o Using the terrain tools to paint some hills and valleys.
o Blend at least two (2) textures onto it.
● Add a character controller.
o You can use the First Person Character Controller from the Standard Assets pack,
find another one on the Asset Store, or make your own.
o Be sure to alter the basic setting of the controllers to change the speed and jump
height of the character to best work with your level.

● Create an obstacle course where the player must traverse to collect items.
o Give the player ten (10) collectables to find (they can be anything you want).
▪ Instead of using the provided code mentioned in the tutorials videos,
code your own system and UI collect your objects. This may involve a
little research, but it should be easily done.

o The level must be a mix of at least two of the following elements: scavenger
hunting, mazes, and/or platforming.
o You may use any royalty free assets you find on the Asset Store to add to the
level. This includes art, music, sound effects, visual effects, character controllers,
etc. Just be sure to give credit for the content you use.
o You may also create content in your level (such as platforms and basic geometry)
using the basic objects found under GameObject&gt;3D Object.
o Completion of the course should take 5-10 minutes (no less, no more)
● Export out a build by going to File&gt;Build Settings&gt;Build.
o Save and name the export using this naming convention:
▪ Unity_OC_(Your First Initial and Last Name)
▪ Example: Unity_OC_MMarquit
o Don&#39;t forget to include all the files and folders that are created upon export
when you submit your work. The game will not run if you only post the .exe file.
