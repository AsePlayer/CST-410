# CST-410: Game Design & Game Play Lecture & Lab
## Taught by Matthew Marquit

This course covers conceptual models for game design. Students analyze various computer games and develop an understanding of game concepts like history, genres, storylines, gameplay elements and challenges, and the design process. Students survey several modern tools and technologies used to create games. The laboratory reinforces and expands learning of principles introduced in the lecture. Hands-on activities focus on creating game storyboards, designing game levels with increasing complexity, and representations of real life phenomena and processes. Prerequisite: CST-320.
