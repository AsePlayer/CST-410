# Lab Question 2
Assessment Description
What is considered "fun" or “right” for a given situation when it comes to game design will be heavily influenced by the game's genre. For example, look at Nintendo's incredibly diverse Mario universe. Consider the differences in how Mario Maker levels are made and played as compared to a game like Mario Kart or even Mario Party. In order to best design your own game, you must first analyze what makes other games in the same genre both fun and successful.

Start by determining what genre the game you will be creating during this semester will be. Now, in 400-650 words, answer the following questions:

* What design concepts are considered "best practices" for this specific genre within the videogame industry?
    * Describe a minimum of six genre-specific game design practices.
* Do you plan on implementing the aforementioned practices within your game? If so, how?
* On the flip side, what makes your game stand out from other games in the genre?
------------
The game we are creating this semester will be an action-adventure turn-based RPG.

**Best Practices**

**Keep things simple:** in AI algorithms, it is especially important to keep the code simple, since these algorithms tend to become extremely complex very quickly. This can make maintenance and debugging difficult.
**Modular architecture:**  a general programming concept that involves separating a program's functions into independent pieces or building blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality.
**Status effects:** Many developers make the mistake of relying on color alone to convey status effects. Between 5% and 8% of men have some kind of color blindness. Fortunately, there are common visual design elements and principles that you can use to communicate status effects to your players.
**Pacing:** In action games, it is important to have moments of downtime accompanied by your hardcore action to give the player a break. Constant ramp up eventually has diminishing returns, and it can be used more effectively by changing up the pace.
**Flow:** It’s the Goldilocks principle, effectively, and the best descriptor for this right amount of challenge, a challenge that is neither too hard nor too easy, is the concept of flow.
**Fluid Controls:** Great games have great controls. If a game doesn’t “feel” good to play, your player’s patience will wear thin quickly. A big factor of replayability, it is the tools with which your player builds their experience.

I do plan on implementing all of the aforementioned practices within my game, and I already have some prior experience with a few of them. I experimented with modular architecture last year in my AI and Simulation class, and I was left with a positive impression from the experience. I did learn a lot of what not to do, which is also a very helpful prerequisite to knowing what to do. While the goal is to keep things simple for this class, we will be able to ramp up the complexity in the 2nd year of our capstone project, which is also this game. The flow and pacing of the game will be important, as nobody wants a game to devolve into a grindfest that you must try over and over. We will also be exploring the concept of death mechanics, as I have recently became infatuated with the idea of death not being the end of the player’s game loop. A lot of this game will come down to the fluid controls, as turn-based games can often come with a lot of menus, reading, and focus involved. Although we want to make this game fun to play and easy to understand at a quick glance, we do still desire that extra level of skill ceiling to exist for advanced and pro players to strive for as well.

What makes my game stand out from other games in this genre is the setting, attention to detail, and raw energy of it. You won’t find a game like this anywhere else out there, and nobody else is capable of delivering this project with such raw passion! I can't wait to introduce you into the world of Mr. Nugs!
