# Lab Question 7
Assessment Description
The design mantra that states "There is no reason to re-invent the wheel" is especially true when it comes to things like a user interface (UI). The game industry often uses common themes among genres that gamers are familiar with instead of confusing players by trying to do something completely different every time. Game developers are especially careful when it comes to UI as using common and time-tested layouts will help players better comprehend and understand what is being communicated.

In **400-650 words**:

* **Find 10 common UI elements** among games in the genre of your game. (Note: This is UI elements only, NOT gameplay elements.)
* Explain why you believe each trope is used.
* Consider such things as the location on the element on the screen, size and proportion, color, animations, graphics (icons) vs. text, how the elements change due to input (either from the game or the player), and so on.

Mr. Nugs Game Genre: Action/RPG

1. **Health:** We are trying something different with the health mechanic, one of the core UI elements. Rather than borrowing from the typical RPG genre's health bar or health/max health format, we are using "Morsels" instead. Morsels are basically glorified lives with health bars. We derived the mechanic from Madness: Project Nexus, which features a similar "Corpus" system. As a way to show the life force of an object, it is especially useful for our purposes.

2. **Movement:** Although there are RPGs that exist where movement is a core mechanic, it is usually displayed in the UI in the form of a grid. The grid is commonly used because it is an easy way for the code and the player to understand and follow the rules of the world. By having a circle radius that the player can walk within, we aim to shatter the grid trope and opt for more natural distance-based movement instead. This UI decision will be simple and intuitive for the player! 

3. **Status Effects:** In line with most RPGs, we intend to make active status effects visible to the player in the UI. We also plan to add a feature to explain the status effects when hovering over them. Not enough games do this!

4. **Information:** An inspection option can introduce fun worldbuilding into the game. A robust UI that can support reading stats, descriptions, and quirks about Units will enhance the user experience.

5. **Ring Menu:** By providing a circular menu that allows the player to spin through resources or actions, a lot of options can be packed into a small footprint. 

6. **Physical Limitations:** As Nuggets lose morsels (or lives), they suffer physical damage and lose pieces of themselves to heighten the user experience and visually convey it. 

7. **Scrolling Text:** The dialogue box with scrolling text is one of the most common storytelling user interface tropes. There is no need to reinvent the wheel here, since this technique is efficient and straightforward.

8. **Statistics Page:** There are only so many practical ways of displaying statistics to the player without causing confusion. RPGs usually display them all at once on a screen line-by-line, and this seems like a solid choice that will not require much modification.

9. **Leveling Up:** It will be fun for the player when their stat numbers increase with an animation. This is a very effective serotonin booster for the player and fits right into our progression plan for Mr. Nugs.

10. **Spacial Components:** Spatial user interface components are located in a game's world, but characters within the game don't see them. Spatial components serve as visual aids pointing out key landmarks or helping players select objects. As a result, ambiguity is easily removed and players remain immersed in the game.
