# Lab Question 6
Assessment Description
Before creating your own level designs it is important to think back on the games and levels that made a lasting impression on you. Doing so will allow you to gain a better understanding of what really is happening behind the scenes.

* Discuss in 400-650 words what you consider is your favorite and least favorite videogame level.
* List specific reasons why you liked/hated it and what made it stand out to you for the right or wrong reasons.
* Questions to consider:
    * What gameplay used in this level made it amazing or if you didn't like it, what were the gameplay elements that ruined it?
    * Did the level tell or further the game's story, if so, how? (if it applies)
    * What was the lighting/sounds/art of the environment like in the level?
    * What mood did it convey?
    * Was there anything innovative or completely game-breaking about the level? If so, what was it?

_Favorite:_

**Viscera Cleanup Detail's** "Uprinsing" Level

https://viscera-cleanup-detail.fandom.com/wiki/Uprinsing

* In Viscera Cleanup Detail, the player takes on the role of a Janitor cleaning up after freak accidents involving mangled corpses, guts, blood splatters, bullet holes, shell casings, and more. Although the initial premise of Viscera seems boring, I somehow still found myself spending over 50+ hours cleaning digital rooms. These maps could take typically 1-4 hours each!

* It was enjoyable to clean each Viscera room because each one had a unique story to tell. Captain's logs could be found scattered around. Writing could be found on the walls. Strange residue indicating some sort of freak accident (unlike the last). Bullet holes and mangled corpses could be seen as evidence of a struggle, and a sinister plot was certainly unfolding in the background. The environments were always spot-on, if not a bit too dark.

* However, none of this was the player's concern, as they were simply the Janitor, who arrived after the events had taken place so they are not immediately threatened. They are left to their own imagination as to what caused the mess.

* On one level, the janitorial employees of Aerospace Sanitation Inc. have staged an uprising at one of its office buildings, demanding better working conditions. The coup has ended with the deaths of several janitors, and it is the player's job to clean up all evidence of the protest. There was graffiti indicating they were abandoned, demanding better wages, etc. In light of these circumstances, the Player Janitor needs to separate themself from the reality of the situation and begin working as if it were just another day in the life.


_Least Favorite:_

**Stick War: Legacy's** "Swordwrath" Level

* The gameplay of this level initially flowed very well. In the previous level, the player had just unlocked the ranged units, the "Archidons". They would now be facing Swordmen who would be attacking immediately. The player is meant to control the Archer and headshot the Swordmen that constantly flow in 1-by-1. This worked as a "silent tutorial" in my opinion, but obviously, some kids would get stuck.

* In response, the developer created an unskippable Archidon tutorial where the player kills a single Swordwrath. They then prevented the enemy Swordwrath from attacking again. Now, they just pile up endlessly at their base and are unable to be physically defeated. What's most awful is the Swordmen block too, so you can't even control the Archer and learn those headshot mechanics anymore!

* You have no choice but to spam Archidons and attack in a long, drawn-out way instead! This is a major downgrade in the quality of that level, and it drastically shifted the mood from being on your back foot to being invulnerable. In general, this change has led to a net worsening of the game.
