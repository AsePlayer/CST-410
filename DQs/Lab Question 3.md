# Lab Question 3
Assessment Description
Games entertain through gameplay, but many also entertain by taking the player away to an imaginary place—a game world. The gameplay in most single-player videogames appears to the player as interactions between them and the game world. Therefore, developing a believable and dynamic world is an important part of the game design process. The questions you will be answering here are about identifying the key elements that make such a world.

The five dimensions include:
* Physical
* Temporal
* Environmental
* Emotional
* Ethical
Start by choosing **two existing game worlds** (from two (2) separate games) that you are familiar with.

In **400-650 words**, analyze what makes these worlds appealing and engaging to the player and briefly describe each of the five dimensions within it.

For each game, be sure to also answer the following questions:

* What are the essential elements that best define each of the five dimensions within the game?
* How do the five dimensions work together to form a complex environment?
* How does the ethical dimension of this game world compare with a Christian worldview?

------------
World 1: Madness Combat

1. **Physical:** Somewhere in Nevada. Large scale, but with obvious obstructions such as barriers that prevent you from exploring it too vastly.
2. **Temporal:** Time is not relevant at all in this world, except for the timing of attacks!
3. **Environmental:** Overall a grey and dark atmosphere with a red gradient sky. There is a semblance of a society with buildings, cars, and jobs within this world despite the pure focus on madness and violence.
4. **Emotional:** There is no regret and no remorse in this universe. Fear and anxiety are only experienced when they know the end is near. The lore of this world hints to the possibility that nobody is truly controlling themselves. There is occasionally comradery amongst allies.
5. **Ethical:** It is canon in this game that nobody in the Madness universe is a “good person.” Some are just worse than others.

These elements work together to form a complex environment because almost everybody is out to get you. There are even instances of infighting, which show that the world’s struggles are much bigger than yours alone. With every character lacking morals, it is easy for the player to slip into the role of the bloodthirsty killer, as you do not feel bad for any of your victims: in fact, they kinda deserved it!

Christian Worldview: There is a character with a Halo called “Jebus” in this world. There are also cult members that worship those who "float". Morals are out the window!

World 2: Dead by Daylight

1. Physical: Generally a big square map with clearly defined borders and an exit gate.
2. Temporal: The Survivors have to power up 5 generators that take 90 seconds each to finish. They then have to power an exit gate that takes time as well. Outside of this, time does not play a factor in the overall world.
3. Environmental: Many locations including: Corn field, Forest, Swamp, Meatpacking Facility, Halloween Neighborhood, etc. Maps are littered with buildings, pallets, and meathooks. 
4. Emotional: There is a unique bond between the Survivors: their goal is to all escape together. They feel fear and anxiety as the Killer gets closer, as an audible heartbeat is present. The Killers have no emotion when it comes to the Survivors or they enjoy their suffering.
5. Ethical: The Survivors will attempt to save each other off of Meat Hooks and try to escape together. While Survivors can die, the remaining ones don't seem bothered by it. The killers have no remorse and kill to please "the Entity." The more fear they instill within the Survivor, the better.

Due to the asymmetrical nature of the four survivors versus the killer, these elements all work together to form a complex environment. There are drastic differences between the experiences of the Survivors and the Killer. The Survivors feel fear and want to work together to get away. The Killer is intent on disrupting the Survivors’ teamwork and torturing them slowly. Unfortunately, there is also the potential for toxicity in this situation, as it is very much a mentality of "us vs them."

Christian Worldview: The Killers in this game worship this unknown force that thrives off of the Survivor’s suffering called “the Entity.”
