# Lab Question 1
Assessment Description
Unity is an incredibly powerful tool that is capable of creating a wide array of games. To help illustrate this point, you will do a little research of your own into what makes this engine so powerful.

## Part 1: 

Research the Unity game engine and post your answers to the following questions:

What are some…

Notable games that have been created or are being created within the Unity game engine?
Notable companies & developers that are or have used the Unity game engine (beyond those that worked on the games you previously mentioned)?
Of the engine’s strengths?
Of the engine’s weaknesses?
## Part 2:

Unity offers what is known as the Asset Store, a marketplace where content creators can sell art, sound effects, enhancements, and numerous other things that can help small developers with their game projects.

Explore the Unity Asset Store to see what kind of assets are being offered and how they might be useful.

What are a few items on the marketplace you find personally interesting and why?
Post the links to at least two of these items in your response.
------------

**Notable games that have been created or are being created within the Unity game engine?**
Madness: Project Nexus, Stick War: Legacy, Cuphead, Fall Guys, Genshin Impact

**Notable companies & developers that are or have used the Unity game engine**
Activision, Cubix, Whimsy Games, QuyTech

**Of the engine’s strengths?**

* All of the bells and whistles out of the box
* Automatically optimizes itself in the compilation phase
* Robust 2D and 3D physics
* Animation System
* Github-like system "Plastic"
* Used to make more than just games (Movies, Art, etc)


**Of the engine’s weaknesses?**

* Documentation is spotty
* No external code libraries
* Prefabs
* Bloated features you will probably not use
* The limitation of the visual editor


**What are a few items on the marketplace you find personally interesting and why?**

1. Dynamic Space Backgrounds - it's cool to see the customizability of an entire galaxy. There is a surprising amount of control and customizability that that they afford (especially the expensive ones!)
2. Tank assets - There are all sorts of cool 2D and 3D tank assets. Some are more robust than others, with different degrees of customizability. They all have a different look and feel that may or may not suit your project, so there is a lot to choose from!
