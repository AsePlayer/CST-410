# Lab Question 4
Assessment Description
The willing suspension of disbelief is a mental state that players enter into when playing a game. The better your game supports this concept, the more "immersed" in the game's world the player will become. It has often been said that "Immersiveness is one of the holy grails of game design."

In **400-650 words**, answer the following questions:

* Based on your personal experience/opinion, what are some of the most important elements that help with suspending the player's disbelief while also completely immersing them within the game?
    * Name and describe at least five different elements.
* Now choose a game that has completely immersed you; identify and evaluate what elements you believed caused this and why.
------------
Players must be immersed in order to suspend their disbelief; these elements are crucial to achieving this:

1. Consistent rules in-universe
2. Few artificial restrictions on gameplay
3. Visuals with a consistent style and "feel"
4. Complimentary music and SFX to the visuals
5. Natural repetition that doesn't disrupt imagination


Game: Cult of the Lamb


Reasoning:
Cult of the Lamb casts players in the role of a possessed lamb saved from annihilation by an ominous stranger. You must repay your debt by building a loyal following in his name. Your mission is to create your own cult in a land of false prophets by venturing into diverse and mysterious regions, gathering a devoted group of woodland followers, and spreading your message throughout the world.

This game brilliantly blends a Roguelike gameplay loop with a colony-management sim. As the Lamb, players will crusade for resources and followers in the randomized dungeons. After defeating the heretics, they return home to take care of the cult's base. Managing the cult is a monumental task: you have to manage your members' hunger, faith, cleanliness, and more! If your followers grow too agitated with you, they will dissent and spread falsehoods among your cult. However, this can easily be taken care of by performing a ritual or throwing the dissenter in jail until they are reformed.

While this game has an extreme sinister overtone, its visuals are reminiscent of a cute animal crossing-like style. The soundtrack matches the theme very well and its creative use of vocals gives the game a very charming appeal. In addition to building a custom base layout, the player can declare doctrines for their followers to follow. This will shape the cult’s passive effects as well as unlock new interactions between followers. The game encourages the player to engage in terrible deeds that are carried out in the cutest way possible, helping to suspend the player’s disbelief. As the ominous stranger put it: “Your follower’s loyalty is a resource. Spend it as you would gold, for one can easily earn back favor with a gift or well-placed gesture of kindness. Let this empower you to do unspeakable things…”

This game offers numerous solutions to various problems that you may face as a Cult leader. Whether it be a ritual for sacrificing, fasting, feasting, resurrecting, or administering hallucinogenic drugs, the Player can continuously make big impact decisions that help progress and maintain their cult. In this way, it allows the player freedom to play the game the way they want to with few artificial restrictions on gameplay. In addition, the natural repetition has no effect on the imagination, because there are many unique events that can take place, and death is not punished to the same degree as most other roguelikes. Additionally, you can easily spend hours just maintaining your cult and not even moving forward in the story and still have lots of fun. Quests are often presented in the form of requests by your cult members which you can complete to raise their faith.

For these reasons and more, Cult of the Lamb is definitely a game that has completely immersed me!
