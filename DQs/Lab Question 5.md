# Lab Question 5
Assessment Description
At the root of all gameplay is the underlying core mechanics. When creating balanced and fun gameplay, all the various components of the game must be specifically designed to complement and support these original core mechanics. In order to gain a better understanding of how you can accomplish this within your own designs, you must research into how some of the most popular and successful games were able to accomplish this themselves.

* What is the game’s main winning and losing condition(s)?
* How does the game primarily reward the player?
* What does the game do to punish the player for inappropriate of poor play?
* What about the core mechanics makes this game fun?
